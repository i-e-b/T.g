# T·g
A simple C# generator for HTML/XML

## Why?
Sometimes you have a project where a lot of code is needed to output a little markup. For those projects, markup templating engines make things more difficult, and a lot of the time you end up doing string concatenation. T·g is one step up from string concatenation.
